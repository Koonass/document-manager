ENHANCED ERROR LOGGING - READY FOR TESTING
================================================================================

I've updated the print system to capture MUCH more detailed information.

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
The error log will now show:

1. Preset configuration being used (which printers, how many copies)
2. Each order being processed (order number, PDF path, PDF exists?)
3. Each printer being attempted (11x17, 24x36, folder label)
4. Detailed errors when prints fail (exact error message, context)
5. Full stack traces for exceptions

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Delete the old log file:
   - Delete: print_errors.log

2. Try printing again:
   - Select 1-2 orders
   - Click "Create Batch"
   - Select "Standard Plot" preset
   - Click "Review & Print"

3. Send me the NEW print_errors.log

This time it will show EXACTLY what's failing and why.

IMPORTANT:
----------
Make sure to delete the old print_errors.log first so we only see
the new detailed errors!
