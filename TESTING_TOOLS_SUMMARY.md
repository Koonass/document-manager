# Testing Tools - Quick Reference

## Overview

Your print system now has comprehensive error tracking and diagnostic tools. Here's what's available:

---

## 🔧 Diagnostic Tools

### 1. **Diagnostic Report Generator**
- **File**: `src/print_diagnostics.py`
- **Quick Run**: Double-click `run_diagnostics.bat`
- **What it does**:
  - Checks system information
  - Lists all available printers
  - Verifies required modules
  - Tests preset configuration
  - Checks database status
- **Output**: `print_diagnostic_report.txt`
- **When to use**: **FIRST THING** when testing on a new machine

### 2. **Error Logger**
- **File**: `src/error_logger.py`
- **Automatic**: Runs in background during app usage
- **What it does**:
  - Logs all errors with timestamps
  - Captures full stack traces
  - Records context (order numbers, printer names, etc.)
- **Output**: `print_errors.log`
- **When to use**: Automatically captures errors as they happen

### 3. **Log Viewer** (Built into App)
- **File**: `src/log_viewer.py`
- **Access**: Will be added to app menu/toolbar
- **What it does**:
  - Shows recent errors in a nice UI
  - Copy button to share logs
  - Refresh to see new errors
  - Clear log button
- **When to use**: To quickly check what errors occurred

## 🚀 Testing Workflow on Office Machine

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
1. Copy project folder to office PC
2. Open Command Prompt
3. Run: `run_diagnostics.bat`
4. **SEND ME**: `print_diagnostic_report.txt`

### Phase 2: Basic Testing
1. Run app: `python run_v2_3.py`
2. Open Preset Manager
3. Configure a preset
4. Try printing 1 order
5. **IF ERRORS**: Send me `print_errors.log`

### Phase 3: Full Testing
1. Test with multiple orders
2. Test different categories (green/red/gray)
3. Test folder label skipping logic
4. **IF ISSUES**: Send me both log files

## 📤 What to Send When Something Goes Wrong

### Minimum (Required):
1. **`print_diagnostic_report.txt`** - System info
2. **Description** - What you were doing

### If Errors Occurred:
3. **`print_errors.log`** - Detailed error log

### If UI Issues:
4. **Screenshots** - Show what looks wrong

### Optional (Helps a lot):
5. **Printer details** - Make/model of printers
6. **Network info** - Is print server slow?
7. **Windows version** - Check in Settings > System > About

---

## 🎯 Quick Troubleshooting

### "No printers found"
```
1. Check print spooler service is running
2. Run: run_diagnostics.bat
3. Send me the report
```

### "Module not found"
```
1. Run: pip install pywin32 PyPDF2 python-docx
2. Try again
3. If still fails, send error message
```

### "Timeout errors"
```
This is normal for slow print servers!
- Check print_errors.log
- Note which printer is slow
- Tell me the timeout duration you need
```

### "Preset editor blank"
```
1. Click on preset name in left list
2. Take screenshot
3. Send: print_errors.log + screenshot
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run diagnostics FIRST** - Saves time debugging
2. **Keep logs between tests** - Shows progression of issues
3. **Screenshot everything** - Pictures worth 1000 words
4. **Test small batches first** - 1-2 orders, then scale up
5. **Note what changed** - Did you change settings? Install something?

## 📞 What I Need From You

**Best case scenario:**
```
1. Diagnostic report (always)
2. Error log (if errors happened)
3. Brief description of what happened
```

**Even better:**
```
1. Diagnostic report
2. Error log
3. Screenshots
4. Step-by-step what you did
5. Printer details (make/model)
```

**Absolute minimum:**
```
1. Some indication of what went wrong
2. Any error messages you saw
   (Even a photo of the screen works!)
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

When everything works, you should see:
- [ ] Diagnostics report shows all printers
- [ ] Preset Manager opens with 3 presets visible
- [ ] Can edit and save presets
- [ ] Printer dropdowns show your printers
- [ ] Can select orders and create batch
- [ ] Progress dialog shows printing
