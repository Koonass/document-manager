HOW TO ADD BOOKMARKS TO WORD TEMPLATE
================================================================================

ERROR: "bookmark not found in template"

This means your Word template is missing the required bookmarks.

================================================================================
QUICK FIX - Add Bookmarks to Template
================================================================================

STEP 1: Open the template
---------------------------
Navigate to:
  C:\code\Document Manager\LABEL TEMPLATE\Contract_Lumber_Label_Template.docx

Double-click to open in Microsoft Word


STEP 2: Add bookmarks for each field
-------------------------------------
For EACH field where you want order data to appear:

a) SELECT the text/placeholder
   Example: Select "Customer Name Here" or "BUILDER NAME"

b) Click INSERT tab → Bookmark button

c) Type the bookmark name EXACTLY as shown below

d) Click ADD

e) The text should now have a bookmark (might see gray brackets in Word)


STEP 3: Required bookmarks to add
----------------------------------
You MUST add these 4 bookmarks:

Bookmark Name: builder
  → Maps to: Customer Name
  → Select text where customer name should appear
  → Insert → Bookmark → Type "builder" → Add

Bookmark Name: Lot / subdivision
  → Maps to: Job Reference/Lot Number
  → Select text where lot/job info should appear
  → Insert → Bookmark → Type "Lot / subdivision" → Add
  → NOTE: Include the space and forward slash!

Bookmark Name: floors
  → Maps to: Delivery Area/Floor
  → Select text where delivery area should appear
  → Insert → Bookmark → Type "floors" → Add

Bookmark Name: designer
  → Maps to: Designer Name
  → Select text where designer name should appear
  → Insert → Bookmark → Type "designer" → Add


STEP 4: Optional bookmarks
---------------------------
These are optional but recommended:

Bookmark Name: OrderNumber
  → Maps to: Order Number
  → Select text where order number should appear
  → Insert → Bookmark → Type "OrderNumber" → Add

Bookmark Name: DatePrinted
  → Maps to: Print Date/Time (auto-generated)
  → Select text where print date should appear
  → Insert → Bookmark → Type "DatePrinted" → Add


STEP 5: Save the template
--------------------------
File → Save (or Ctrl+S)
Close Microsoft Word


STEP 6: Verify the bookmarks
-----------------------------
Run this to check if bookmarks are correct:

  CHECK_TEMPLATE_BOOKMARKS.bat

This will show you which bookmarks were found and which are missing.


================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

✓ Bookmark names are CASE-SENSITIVE
  Must be exactly: builder, floors, designer, "Lot / subdivision"

✓ "Lot / subdivision" includes space and slash
  Type it exactly: Lot / subdivision

✓ Don't delete the text when adding bookmarks
  Select the text, then add bookmark - text stays

✓ You can reuse bookmarks
  If you delete text with a bookmark, you need to recreate the bookmark

✓ Verify after adding
  Run CHECK_TEMPLATE_BOOKMARKS.bat to confirm

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Use the Sample Template
================================================================================

If you want a pre-configured template:

1. Check if there's a working template in:
   C:\code\Document Manager\DESIGN FILES\Template.docx

2. Copy it to:
   C:\code\Document Manager\LABEL TEMPLATE\Contract_Lumber_Label_Template.docx

3. Run CHECK_TEMPLATE_BOOKMARKS.bat to verify

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Can't see bookmark names in Word?
----------------------------------
File → Options → Advanced → Show document content
→ Check "Show bookmarks"
Now you'll see bookmarks with gray [ ] brackets


Bookmark disappears when typing?
---------------------------------
When you type in a bookmarked area, the bookmark gets deleted.
You need to re-add it after typing.


Wrong bookmark name used?
--------------------------
Delete the bookmark:
  Insert → Bookmark → Select bookmark → Delete

Then add it again with correct name.


Still getting "bookmark not found"?
------------------------------------
1. Run CHECK_TEMPLATE_BOOKMARKS.bat
2. Compare output to required bookmarks above
3. Add any missing bookmarks
4. Save template
5. Test printing again

================================================================================
WHAT THE CODE EXPECTS
================================================================================

The word_template_processor.py file looks for these EXACT bookmark names:

  builder           → Customer name
  Lot / subdivision → Job reference
  floors            → Delivery area
  designer          → Designer name
  OrderNumber       → Order number (optional)
  DatePrinted       → Print timestamp (optional)

If your template has DIFFERENT bookmark names (like "Customer" or "LotSub"),
the code won't find them and you'll get "bookmark not found" error.

================================================================================

Need more help? Run: CHECK_TEMPLATE_BOOKMARKS.bat
This will show exactly which bookmarks are missing.
